## ⚠️ Important Reality Check

Before starting Project #2, answer honestly:

### Can you modify this project confidently?

Test yourself:
1. Can you change the color scheme without breaking anything?
2. Can you add a new section (e.g., "Case Studies")?
3. Can you integrate a real form API (e.g., Formspree)?
4. Can you explain how dark mode works to a client?

If you answered NO to any:
→ **Spend 1-2 hours exploring the code**
→ Make small changes
→ Break things, fix them
→ Understand before showcasing

**Why?** Clients will ask:
- "Can you match this design?" (Figma integration)
- "Can we connect to Mailchimp?" (API integration)
- "Can we add a blog section?" (Content expansion)

If you only know how to generate, not modify, this becomes fragile fast.
